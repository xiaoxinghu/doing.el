#+todo: IDEA TODO | DONE KILLED

For new feature/task to be marked as =DONE=, make sure that:
- all existing tests passes
- new tests are added for guarding the new feature, and passing
  - design tests with purpose, only test things that tend to remain unchanged in a long term, e.g. the interface (interactive functions), and concrete logic about the fundamental functionality of the app.
  - add necessary tests that can help verify the intended behaviours
